A ordered and structured mail catcher made for large environments with high e-mail traffic from multiple sources.
With the global level filtering and user defined filtering it's easy to maintain structure in debugging with multiple
developers and servers.

Features
--------

* Catch and debug in realtime: Real-time updates when messages are being received by the server.

* SMTP Server: Includes a basic SMTP server to catch all messages on. The SMTP Server runs in a different process as the
  webserver does.

* Filter sets: You can setup global filter sets that can be used by all users. And all users can create their own
  personal filter sets.

* Filtering with rules: Filter sets have multiple rules that can be fully customized. Rules apply on different fields
  of the e-mail messages.

* User system: You can optional enable the authentication required command in the settings. This will require an
  authenticated user in order to use the catcher.

* Social Authentication: Allows your users to authenticate with social authentication. This can be really useful when
  your company uses Google for Domains, you can easily allow the specific domain to be allowed.

* REST Api: Allows you and (optional) your users to create awesome integrations for creating filters, rules and reading
  several data from the lurker.
